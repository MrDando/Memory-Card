# Memory Card

A simple memory game where the objective of the game is to select as many cards in a row without selecting a card more than once.

There are a total of 40 cards in the deck, so while the game is technically winnable by correctly selecting all of them without selecting any card twice it is close to impossible to achieve.

Just try to get as large highscore as you can.
